- Pre-Submit:
    - Check output is equivalent to provided test cases
    - Test more cases if not confident
        - Compute small test cases to test against
    - Determine edge-cases
- General:
    - Re-read problem
    - Explain problem & hence solution to teammate (mascot)
    - Have a snack
    - Check type casting in computation and output
    - Division by zero?
- Wrong Answer:
    - Check output format
    - Check boundary test cases
    - Check '==' vs '>=' vs '<='
    - Are values initialized & reset properly?
- Time Limit Exceeded:
    - Calculate time complexity
    - Check loops will always complete
    - Are constant factors reasonable?
    - Is all code necessary?
    - Are there inbuilt functions for the same tasks?
